# Carousel Slide Animation Test
A test area for myself to make a carousel that holds images to be selected by the user.

When a user selects an image in the carousel that image is then displayed above it.

The carousel will need to animate sliding 3 images on and show the next 3 iamges.

The carouself will need to animate sliding the current 3 images off and show the previous 3 images.

My main goal is it get the slider to work.
